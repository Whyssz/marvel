> *** - This is the initial version of the project, without the use of hooks, to show (there is a code example) that I'm familiar with react development 

### What technologies were used in the development? ? 
* `react-route` - page navigation (lazy import)
* `react-helmet` - seo
* `transition` - animation (with restriction)
* `api-services`
* `Hooks` 
  * useState | useEffect | useCallback | useMemo | useRef | useHttp* | useScroll | setContent(utils) | memo(HOC)

#### Weaknesses
The layout was based on some skeletal pieces of layout (which were not designed for mobile devices).
No mobile version, I tried to fix the situation, but in some places I could not get rid of the problem completely.
